'''
Givena file will create a schema for a JSON file. To see output in a formatted way, please visit this http://json.parser.online.fr/ 
In the future I want to create a formatter. I'm aware of pprint but it'll print with double quotes, and that isn't very useful. So
in the future I'll probably create a separate print function
